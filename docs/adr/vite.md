# Title

## Status

Adopted

## Context

Create React App (CRA) was great when it came out but it's HMR and general developer experience is slow and cumbersome. Vite offers a light weight and fast alternative with a low conversion learning curve.

## Decision

Utilize Vite instead of CRA.

## Consequences

It would appear that this switch comes with a few minor tweaks to code in pathing but Vite is 100% feature equilivent to CRA.
