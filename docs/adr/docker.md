# Docker

## Status

Adopted

## Context

Embrace containerization and defult to Docker.

## Decision

Docker is still the defacto standard for containerization, keeping it for now.

## Consequences

There are some other runtimes out there that offer some nice features, but none stand out far enough to push moving to them.
