## Kube Tools

Having a basic collection of tools to manage Kubernetes is a must, the kube folder contains some starter scripts and wrappers to get started. Any scripts ending in -k3 are focused on working with local K3s clusters created using K3d.

### helm

### helm-k3

### k3-get-config

### k3d

### kubectl

### kubectl-k3

### update_kube.sh
